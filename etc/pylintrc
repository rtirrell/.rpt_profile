# W0232: class has no __init__
# E1101: class has no member. Unfortunately, often spurious. (NOT USING)
# E1120: no parameter cls in function call (this probably can be removed
#        from the exclude list). This often happens in as_view in URLconfs.
# E1103: has no member ... (but some types could not be inferred).
#        Causes annoying problems in using django test client, response has

[TYPECHECK]
# Will not warn about class not having a member. 
#
# settings is a concession to classes in ACQ, request and kwargs to Django's
# class-based generic views, plus other code in ACQ that relies on controllers
# being setattr()ed on instances, and then user_profile isn't set right either.

# Had to fix the lexer by hand to force it to accept the regexp correctly.
